# Max Wilets Personal Portfolio

## Build Setup

```
 $ yarn
 $ yarn dev
 $ yarn start
```

This will not connect to the CMS for that you will need to follow the instruction on the [Keystone CMS Repo](https://github.com/maxwilets/next-6-integration)
This is my personal portfolio build with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) and can be found live [here](https://maxwilets.io)
